How To Contribute
=================


This github pages branch has a simple ruby script to convert markdown files into styled, well formatted HTML. To edit any of the content, please edit the *markdown* version of the content in the source folder. So for example, to edit the index page, edit source/index.md and *not* index.html. 

Once you have finished your edits, use ruby to run the converstion script, like so:

ruby compile.rb

Once the script finishes, check in all the files (HTML and markdown) as usual and push them up. Your changes will be available soon!

Here is a guide to how the compile script interprets certain markdown elements to automatically create linked navigation:
